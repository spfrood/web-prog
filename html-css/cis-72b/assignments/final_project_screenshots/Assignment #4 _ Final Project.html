<h1>Final Project Sample Printscreens </h1>
<h3>Gallery of Previous students' Final Project solutions <br>
</h3>
<p> Use the following screen shots to get some ideas and inspire some variations. You may not use any of these specific themes. Note that the best themes are actually based on hotels that would probably never really exist, such as most of the hotels shown here. Also notice that different pages are featured on these printscreens so if you look closely you can also pick up some ideas about  formatting the different pages. You can also see some of the variations on layout. </p>
