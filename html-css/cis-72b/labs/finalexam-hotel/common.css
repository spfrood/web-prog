/* 1. Page Styles: On the "body" you must at least set color, background, margin, padding, font family & size.    
   ==============  Optionally, you can also set styles on the page wrapper div here if you like.  
	               But note that you will lose points for any of the above properties that are not set for the body  */

                              and "border".  Feel free to use others instead. Use at least 2 properties.           */

/* 3. Heading Styles: For h1-h3 together, set font-family and color; for each separately set font-size using em or %.   
   =================  Set other styles as needed. Goal is to make heading text stand out from other page text.   
	                  Use text-shadowing on your headings. One of your heading fonts must be an embedded Web font.  */

/* 6. General Link Styles: Style the links outside the nav bar area using at least color and text-decoration

   ========================  Style all 4 link states to make active buttons when hovering. Remove bullets from list display. 
                             Use selectors like "#eventspage #eventslink" to style the link to its own page separately      */

/* 10. Logo Positioning Styles: Absolute Positioning of logo image using "positionme" id. Leave the existing blank div at 
   ===========================  bottom of each page in the html & style it to go toward the top of pages where you like.  
	                            Give it a height & width to match logo image, set image as background, position absolutely */

/* Miscellaneous Styles: Styles that don't fit in any of the above categories but affect multiple pages can go here. 
   ====================  Use only as needed. This section is optional and does not count for any points.                 */
