HTML Tags (reference boards.html)

Intro to CSS for formatting

Replaces majority of old-school formatting tags

example: Don't use <br> for vertical spacing. Use CSS to control exact amount of pixels/percent, etc.

section tags - <section id="main">   THe "id" allows this section to be called out later when using CSS

Sometimes CSS can be intersperced directly into the HTML. Example: in <body> can use the tag format <body style="csspropertyname:propertyvalue; csspropertyname:propertyvalue;"> so background color would be: <body style="background-color:silver;">

Can also put <style></style> inside <head> of document in the format to apply specific styles to certain HTML tag contents as follows:
    <style>
        selector(the html tag to be formatted) {
            cssproperty:propertyvalue; 
            cssproperty:propertyvalue
            }
    </style>
    
    Example of implementation:
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>ABCDEFG</title>
        <style>
            body {
                background-color:silver;
                font-family:sans-serif;
                }
            h1, h2, h3 {
                font-family:Georgia, Times, serif;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
	
	Best method is to put CSS style into their own file that will be referenced by the HTML document
	
Right-click in tag to bring up "quick edit" options to edit the CSS style file remotely
