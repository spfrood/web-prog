3 types of lists in HTML
    1) unordered list
        Items denoted by bullet points 
        Default icon is little circle but can change or sub in custom image
        Tag is 
        <ul> 
            <li>list item</li>
        </ul>
    2) ordered list
        Numbered is default but can change the ordering labels in code
        Tag is
        <ol>
            <li>list item</li>
        </ol>
    3) description list (definition list)
        Items in list can be indented or not. Come in pairs, dt first dd afterwards
        Tag is
        <dl>
            <dt>un-indented list item</dt>
            <dd>indented list item</dd>
        </dl>
        
    Assignment 2
    Focuses on links
    Tag format is: <a attribute="attribute details">link text</a>
    Example:
    <a href="myfile.html">This is the link text</a>!
        NOTE: Better to use local file designations in order to keep the website portable in the 
        event that the DNS entry changes. That way the URL will not have to be edited for every
        link in the page.
