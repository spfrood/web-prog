<h2>Coffees</h2>
<p>All of our coffees can be purchased by the pound in either whole bean or ground form. If you don't see your favorite already ground in our store, we can grind it fresh for you while you wait. In our stores we always have 3 coffees of the day brewed fresh and on hand -- one which is full strength and bold, one  which is  flavored and mild, and one of which is decaf.</p>
<h3>Roasts</h3>
<p>If you prefer something other than the coffees of the day, we generally serve a variety of differently roasted coffees, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dark Roasts</li>
<li>Medium Roasts</li>
<li>Light Roasts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Variety</h3>
<p>In addition to these coffees, we also offer  a variety of flavored coffees as well as many decaf coffees. All of our coffees can be served hot, over ice, or blended. A variety of syrups, creamers and sweeteners are also available, including some for those on low-carb, low-fat, or no-dairy diets. Just let our server know your needs and preferences and they'll be glad to serve it up as you like it. </p>
