CIS-72A Final Exam

Focus on Tables and Forms

Little more with CSS

Tags and Attributes to know:

<form> </form> -> attributes: action(usually web page), method (get or post), type (radio, etc), 
	input (text, etc), 
<table> </table>
table spacing/borders
font-family (serif is default) so if not serif it's been changed
table headers/align/bold?
background color on body and table

Review practice final from class blackboard site.

To make an item in a form required use attribute required="required"   
	** Easiest to do in a textbox.  Maybe with text area as well
	
Do a color change a:hover{ ____ } 
	this is for links in CSS to do something when mouse is over them
